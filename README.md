## Further Notes
I developed `objSpirit` for use in several private projects and recently ported it to the new X3 version of spirit.  
People might ask why including such a heavy dependency like Spirit X3 for a simple obj loader? Just out of curiosity! ;) Spirit is a very interesting, cool and crazy library. So I wanted to get my hands on it and `objSpirit` is the result.
