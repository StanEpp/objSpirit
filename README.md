## objSpirit

`objSpirit` is a wavefront obj loader written in C++14 and utilizing the **Spirit X3** library.

## Further Notes
I developed `objSpirit` for use in several private projects and recently ported it to the new X3 version of spirit.
Spirit X3 is a heavy dependency but a very interesting, cool and crazy library. So I wanted to get my hands on it and `objSpirit` is the result.
